# Boosting classifiers for detection of Diabetes Mellitus with Raman spectroscopy

This repository presents the code created as a final Master's project with which a comparative analysis of the results is carried out by using the [AdaBoost](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002200009791504X "AdaBoost"), [Gradient Boosting](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167947301000652 "Gradient Boosting") and [XGBoost](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2939672.2939785 "XGBoost") boosting techniques, along with PCA and LDA dimensionality reduction techniques, in the dataset Raman spectroscopy of Diabetes, in order to find the best performing model capable of classifying a patient as diabetic or non-diabetic.
